Safety Briefing for Personnel on Orbital Station Omega-7
Effective: Galactic Standard Year 3024
Department: Reactor Core Safety and Extravehicular Operations

1. Preamble on Workplace Safety
Compliance with the following safety regulations is mandatory to ensure life, limb, and the structural integrity of the station. Violations will result in immediate transfer to the trash compactor section.

2. Conduct in the Primary Energy Core Area
(a) Upon entering Sector 7G, personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of a Class IV radiation suit and visual glare protection must be worn at all times without exception.
(b) Manual bypassing of the emergency shutdown device is permitted only by authorised specialist personnel.
(c) Should an acoustic warning signal (siren type "Red Alert") sound, the hazardous area must be evacuated immediately. Remaining for the purpose of heroic acts is prohibited.
(d) Open reactor shafts are not equipped with railings as a structural feature (see Architects' Deficiency Report No. 1138). There is an increased risk of falling. Staff are required to maintain a minimum distance of 2 metres from the shaft edge at all times.

3. Procedure in Case of Pressure Loss (Decompression)
In the event of structural hull damage caused by meteorite impact or hostile laser fire, the bulkhead locking mechanisms will be activated automatically.
(a) Continue breathing calmly, provided there is still atmosphere present.
(b) Reach for the nearest emergency oxygen mask.
(c) Help yourself first, then others (including superiors).

4. Handling Defective Droids
Non-functional maintenance droids must not be repaired independently. Due to faulty motivator units, there is a risk of unpredictable electrical discharges. Report malfunctions immediately to the Department of Robotics and Cybernetics.
