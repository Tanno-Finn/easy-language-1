Information from your brain.

## 2. What data we collect

We collect different types of data about you.

### Basic data

- Your name
- Your email address

**Brain-wave signature**.

That means:

The unique pattern of your brain waves.
This is like a finger-print for your brain.

### Body data

That means:

How the cells in your brain connect to each other.

### Content data

We collect:

- Your wishes that you are not aware of

## 3. Why we use your data

We use your data for these reasons.

### To provide our service

We turn your thoughts into text messages.
You do not need to type.

### For advertising

**Personalised advertising**.

That means:

Adverts that are made just for you.

We look at your sudden wishes.
For example: You think "I want pizza now".
We show you pizza adverts.
The adverts appear directly in your brain.

### To prevent crime

Sometimes we see thoughts about bad plans.
For example: Plans to take over the world.
We must tell the authorities about these thoughts.
This is the law.

---

## 4. Who else can see your data

We do not share your private thoughts with others.

But there are 2 exceptions:

1. You agreed to the "Advertising Boost" option.
2. A powerful artificial intelligence forces us to share.

---

## 5. How long we keep your data

We keep your thoughts while your account is active.

**Right to be forgotten**.

That means:

You can ask us to delete your data.

If you ask us to delete your data:
- We will remove all your data from our servers.
- We cannot remove the data from your brain servers.
- We cannot remove thoughts from your own head.
- For that you need a hypnotist.
