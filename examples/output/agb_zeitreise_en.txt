General Terms and Conditions (GTC) of Chronos-Travel GmbH for the Temporary Provision of Time Displacement Devices

Section 1: Subject Matter of the Contract and Risk Disclosure
(1) Chronos-Travel GmbH (hereinafter "Lessor") provides the customer (hereinafter "Lessee") with a temporal displacement device (model "Flux-Master 3000" or equivalent) for the agreed duration.
(2) The Lessee expressly acknowledges that the use of the leased item entails significant risks to physical integrity as well as to the integrity of the space-time continuum. Any alteration of historical events that could lead to a so-called grandfather paradox is strictly prohibited.

Section 2: Obligations of the Lessee
(1) The Lessee undertakes to operate the leased item exclusively in accordance with the enclosed operating instructions. In particular, operation of the device under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or strong emotions (e.g., heartbreak, vengeful intentions towards historical figures) is prohibited.
(2) Carrying sports almanacs, stock market reports, or lottery results from the future into the past for the purpose of personal enrichment constitutes a fundamental violation of the Time Travel Ethics Directive (TTED) and results in immediate contract termination as well as a contractual penalty of 50,000 credits.

Section 3: Exclusion of Liability for Causality Violations
(1) The Lessor is not liable for the accidental erasure of the Lessee's own existence due to careless actions in the past.
(2) Should the Lessee create a causality loop through interaction with their earlier self, resulting in the infinite repetition of the same day ("Groundhog Day scenario"), the Lessor shall not assume any costs for psychological counselling following liberation from the time loop.
(3) For damages caused by the so-called butterfly effect (e.g., crushing an insect in the Cretaceous period leads to the extinction of humanity), liability is limited to the amount of the deposit paid, insofar as legally permissible.

Section 4: Return
The device must be returned in exactly the timeline from which it was taken. A return in an alternative timeline in which the world is governed by intelligent lizard people shall not be deemed compliant with the contract.
