## Language-Specific Review

### Anchor Phrases
- **Easy:** "Це означає:" (This means:) - ✓ Natural, culturally appropriate
- **Plain:** "Іншими словами:" (In other words:) - ✓ Appropriate for moderate formality

### Grammar Rules
- ✓ SVO order correctly identified as Ukrainian default
- ✓ Participle constructions (дієприкметникові звороти) correctly flagged as complex
- ✓ Passive voice with "-ся" appropriately discouraged
- ✓ Genitive chains correctly identified as problematic
- ✓ Formal "ви" (you) specified for reader address
- ✓ Verb aspect complexity noted

### Ukrainian-Specific Considerations
- ✓ Cyrillic script handling implicit (no special rules needed)
- ✓ No issues with bureaucratic/archaic vocabulary guidance
- ✓ Abbreviation expansion rules present

## Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Title marker:** `[M]` appears in the main title of `easy-ukrainian.md`. This is inconsistent with other directives where `[M]` marks sections only.
   - **Impact:** Cosmetic only
   - **Recommendation:** Remove `[M]` from title in future update

## Conclusion

**Status: APPROVED**

Both Ukrainian directives are complete, well-structured, and follow the META protocol requirements. The directives correctly adapt international Easy-to-Read and Plain Language principles for Ukrainian grammar and cultural context.
