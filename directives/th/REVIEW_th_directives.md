## Thai-Specific Validation

### Anchor Phrase
- **easy-thai.md:** "หมายความว่า:" (That means) - Culturally appropriate
- **plain-thai.md:** "หมายความว่า:" and "กล่าวคือ:" (That is to say) - Both acceptable

### Grammar Rules
- SVO order correctly specified
- Active voice preference maintained
- Sentence length limits appropriate (15 words easy, 25 words plain)

### Cultural Considerations
- Polite particles (ครับ/ค่ะ) correctly explained
- Formal/royal vocabulary (ราชาศัพท์) appropriately avoided in Easy Thai
- Buddhist Era (พ.ศ.) date handling addressed
