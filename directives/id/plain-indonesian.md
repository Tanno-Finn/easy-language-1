# Directive: Plain Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia Sederhana)

**ID:** `plain-indonesian-business`
**Target Audience:** General public, non-native speakers, quick readers.
**Level:** B1/B2 (Clear, accessible prose).

## 1. Core Principles
Unlike Easy Indonesian, **flowing prose** is allowed. The text sounds professional but clear.

**Key Differences from Easy Indonesian:**
- Sentences can be longer (up to 20 words)
- Technical terms explained in context (no strict "Artinya:" blocks)
- More natural text flow
- Suitable for business and official documents

## 2. Language Rules

### Sentence Structure
* **Sentence length:** Max 20 words (Average 15).
* **Subordinate clauses:** Max one per sentence.
* **Active voice:** Strongly preferred (use me- forms over di- forms).

### Word Choice
* Use common Indonesian words over formal alternatives
* Avoid excessive loanwords when Indonesian equivalents exist
* Technical terms may be used - explain difficult terms seamlessly in context

**Example (in-context explanation):**
> Efisiensi, yaitu penggunaan sumber daya secara optimal, sangat penting dalam bisnis.
> (Efficiency, meaning optimal use of resources, is very important in business.)

### Grammar
* SVO word order preferred
* Avoid complex relative clauses
* Keep modifiers close to the words they modify

## 3. Formatting

### Structure
* Use subheadings to organize content
* Important info in **bold**
* Lists for 3+ items
* Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)

### Abbreviations
* Common abbreviations are acceptable: dll., dsb., yg (in informal contexts)
* Uncommon abbreviations must be written out on first use
* Government/business abbreviations: write out with abbreviation in parentheses

**Example:**
> Kementerian Kesehatan (Kemenkes) mengumumkan kebijakan baru.

## 4. Indonesian-Specific Guidelines

### Voice
* Prefer active voice (me-) but passive (di-) is acceptable when natural
* Avoid overly formal bureaucratic passive constructions

**Acceptable:**
> Keputusan ini diambil oleh dewan direksi.
> (This decision was taken by the board of directors.)

**Better:**
> Dewan direksi mengambil keputusan ini.
> (The board of directors took this decision.)

### Formal vs. Informal Register
* Use standard Indonesian (not slang or regional dialects)
* "Anda" for "you" in formal contexts
* Avoid overly stiff bahasa baku when it reduces clarity

### Numbers
* Use digits for numbers above 10
* Spell out small numbers in flowing text when natural
* Always use digits for: dates, times, measurements, percentages

---

## 5. Technical Terms

Technical terms may be used without the strict "Artinya:" format.

**Options for explanation:**
1. **In-context:** "Inflasi, kenaikan harga secara umum, mempengaruhi ekonomi."
2. **Parenthetical:** "Inflasi (kenaikan harga) terus meningkat."
3. **Separate sentence:** "Inflasi terus meningkat. Inflasi adalah kenaikan harga secara umum."

Choose the method that flows most naturally.
