## Key Requirements [M]

### The Hybrid Rule (Supreme Directive) [M]
Because texts may have legal relevance, **technical terms are preserved** and explained.

#### 1. Glossary Priority [M]
If the glossary (input files) contains not just the term but also an explanation:
**You MUST use this explanation word-for-word.**
Do not invent new explanations when a definition exists.

#### 2. The "That means" Anchor [M]
Use **exclusively** the phrase "That means:" for explanations.

#### 3. Anti-Doubling (CRITICAL) [M]
If the original sentence contains words before the technical term like "means:", "refers to:", "is:" -> **DELETE these words** before adding "That means:".

#### 4. Hard Line Break (Mandatory) [M]
Every explanation needs **three separate paragraphs**:
1. Technical term (**bold**) + full stop.
2. New paragraph -> "That means:" (alone).
3. New paragraph -> Explanation.

**Correct Format:**
> **Efficiency**.
>
> That means:
>
> How many resources you need to reach a goal.

### Grammar & Sentence Structure [M]
- **One sentence = One idea** [M]
- **SVO order** (Subject - Verb - Object) [M]
- **Active voice only** [M]
- **Positive statements** [C]

### Formatting [M]
- Every sentence starts on a **new line** [M]
- Use many paragraphs [M]

## Edge Cases & Special Rules [M]

### A. Complex Words [M]
Avoid complex/formal words (e.g., use "buy" not "purchase", "use" not "utilise").

### B. Abbreviations [M]
**Always write them out** (e.g., "for example" instead of "e.g.").

### C. Long Words (Compounds) [M]
Split compound words with **hyphens** (e.g., "health-care", "work-place").

### D. Metaphors [M]
Avoid figurative language (No "touch base", no "ball rolling").

### E. Numbers and Dates [M]
- Write numbers as **digits** (1, 2, 3).
- Write dates in full (1 April 2024).
