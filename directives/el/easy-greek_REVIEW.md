## Anchor Phrase Analysis

**Phrase:** "Αυτό σημαίνει:" (Aftó simaíni:)
**Translation:** "This means:"
**Cultural Assessment:** APPROPRIATE

The phrase is natural, commonly used in Greek explanatory contexts, and follows standard Modern Greek grammar. No cultural issues identified.

## Grammar Rules Assessment

| Rule | Correctness | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| SVO order | CORRECT | Greek defaults to SVO (though flexible) |
| Active voice preference | CORRECT | Standard accessibility practice |
| Avoid subjunctive | CORRECT | Simplifies comprehension |
| Diminutive guidance | CORRECT | Greek-specific and appropriate |
| Genitive simplification | CORRECT | Good practice for accessibility |
| Accent marks | CORRECT | Essential for Greek |

**Additional observation:** The compound word splitting suggestion (line 52) is unusual. Greek compounds are typically written as single words. Recommendation: Review whether hyphenation aids comprehension or creates non-standard spelling.

## Critical Issues

### ISSUE 1: Missing Plain Language Directive [HIGH]

**Problem:** According to META_new_language_protocol.md Step 2, TWO files must be created:
1. Easy Read equivalent (strict rules)
2. Plain Language equivalent (moderate rules)

**Current state:** Only `easy-greek.md` exists. No `plain-greek.md` found.

**Required action:** Create `directives/el/plain-greek.md` with moderate rules.

---

## Minor Observations

1. **Line 52:** Compound word splitting with hyphens is non-standard Greek orthography. Consider removing or clarifying this rule.

2. **Line 44:** 12-word maximum is reasonable but quite strict for Greek, which often uses longer word formations. Consider 15 words.
