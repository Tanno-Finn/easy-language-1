## Summary

**Overall Assessment:** FULL PASS

Both Vietnamese directives are **excellent**:

1. **easy-vietnamese.md**: Comprehensive cognitive accessibility directive with proper Vietnamese linguistic adaptations including tonal diacritics rules, classifier guidance, and Sino-Vietnamese handling.

2. **plain-vietnamese.md**: Appropriate relaxation of rules for plain language while maintaining core structure. Good differentiation between Easy and Plain variants.

**Highlights:**
- Correct SVO word order for Vietnamese
- Emphasis on tonal diacritics preservation (critical for Vietnamese)
- Thoughtful pronoun guidance (kinship-based pronouns complexity acknowledged)
- Appropriate handling of Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary
- Clear distinction between Easy (strict) and Plain (moderate) formats

**No action required.**
