# Vision

## What This Project Shows

- A basic dispatcher-worker loop
- File-based job management (no database)
- The "Hybrid Rule" concept (keep technical terms, explain them)
- Scaling directives across 15+ languages

## What This Is NOT

- Production-ready software
- A real translation service
- Something novel or groundbreaking

Just a small showcase.

## Current State

- 15 languages implemented
- 8 more planned (Priority A tickets exist)
- ~300 test jobs processed

## If I Were to Make This Real

Would need:
- Actual database for job queue
- Proper error handling and retries
- API instead of file-based I/O
- Quality metrics and feedback loops
- Professional linguistic review

But that's not the point of this project.
